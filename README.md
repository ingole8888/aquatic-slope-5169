Building Clone Of Site Carb Manager.com

Masai School construct week project.
I am a students of the Masai School Web-17 batch. Currently, currently Iâ€™m in RCT101. In the Masai School, at the end of every unit, the last week is called construct week. In which every student of Masai School has to build a project.

I had a week to build the project.

I use ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Java-script to build the project.

Landing Page.
This is the landing page of the 1mg clone site exactly the same as the Carb Manager.com site. We tried to give some functionally such as carousel Sliding, Tab Switching, Login page, Hover Effects, On-scroll shrinking.

On the landing page, we create a navbar and search bar. If the user clicks on the menu it will show the pages of the section.

Login Page.
On the login page, there are two options login and create an account. If you are a new user you have to click on create the account If you have already an account just enter the registered email and password. And you logged in into website. If you forget your password there is option of forget password you just click on it and you able recover your password form the link provided by us on your registered Email id.

There is another way of login on login page that is login with google if you click on login with google button then you are directly login with your email id with google authentication.

If you click on sign in with google then following page will be open and you are logged in with your email id.
If you click on email id then it collect data from google and redirect you on home page.

This is the footer page we created multiple options where users can connect such as Email, Facebook, Pint-rest and Twitter. Also, we have added a Return policy, about the 1mg.com and Terms of us.
